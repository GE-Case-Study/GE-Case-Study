#### Stating The Problem ####

In the first half of 2018, gas turbines 
belonging to four of our aircraft operators have been 
approaching the end of their remaining useful life (RUL) much 
faster than expected. This unexpected degradation causes 
unplanned outages and requires unscheduled maintenance. The 
result is several days of unplanned downtime for our customers 
and a decreased ability to effectively manage GE inventory.



#### 1) Merging GE Dataset ####

 Use R/MySQL to join these seven datasets, ensuring the correct unit of analysis and the computations of any needed variables


#### 2) Finding RUL Predictons ####

 Using Jupyter to showcare an overview of the variability within the merged data.


#### 3) Interactive Dashboard ####

 Tableau interactive dashboard to showcase relevant features and interesting results.


#### 4) GE Predictive Model ####

 Create models for predicting RUL based on relevant features


#### 5) GE Predictive App ####

 Turning the predictive model into an app for efficiency
