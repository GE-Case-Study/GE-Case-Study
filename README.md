#### Stating The Problem 

In the first half of 2018, gas turbines 
belonging to four of our aircraft operators have been 
approaching the end of their remaining useful life (RUL) much 
faster than expected. This unexpected degradation causes 
unplanned outages and requires unscheduled maintenance. The 
result is several days of unplanned downtime for our customers 
and a decreased ability to effectively manage GE inventory.













#### Merging GE Dataset 

 Use R/MySQL to join these seven datasets, ensuring the correct unit of analysis and the computations of any needed variables




#### Dataset Variability

 Using Jupyter to showcare an overview of the variability within the merged data.




#### Interactive Dashboard 

 Tableau interactive dashboard to showcase relevant features and interesting results.




#### Predictive Modeling 

 Create models for predicting RUL based on relevant features




#### GE Application

 Turning the predictive model into an app for efficiency
